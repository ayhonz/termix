How does text editor work? I have no idea so I'd like build one :)

Basic text editor supporting text manipulation in go.
This project uses only one external package tcell for easier manipulation with terminal.

## Requirements/features:
- [] load file
- [] save file
- [] basic movement around text (VIM like)
- [] insert
- [] delete
- [] selection
- [] mode switching (edit, normal)
- [] support for mouse

If I'll be brave enough ;)
- [] redo/undo
- [] word wrapping
