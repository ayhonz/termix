How does terminal text editor work? I have no idea so I'd like build one :)

Basic text editor supporting text manipulation in go.
I'm interested only in the text editor part, so GUI and terminal manipulation is out of the scope and 3rd party will be used for that.

## Requirements/features:
[] load file
[] save file
[] basic movement around text
[] insert
[] delete
[] selection
[] mode switching (edit, normal)
[] support for mouse
